/**
 * Invert any goal.
 * <p>
 * In the old chat control system, #invert just tried to pick a {@link GoalRunAway} that <i>effectively</i> inverted the
 * current goal. This goal just reverses the heuristic to act as a TRUE invert. Inverting a Y level? Baritone tries to
 * get away from that Y level. Inverting a GoalBlock? Baritone will try to make distance whether it's in the X, Y or Z
 * directions. And of course, you can always invert a GoalXZ.
